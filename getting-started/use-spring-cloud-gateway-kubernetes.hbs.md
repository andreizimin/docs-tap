# Use Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes

This topic describes how to use Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes as an API gateway for
workloads running on Tanzu Application Platform.

## <a id="spring-cloud-gateway"></a> Using Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes

Spring Cloud Gateway is a popular project library for creating an API Gateway that is built on top of
the Spring ecosystem.

The OSS library is a foundational component of VMware Spring Cloud Gateway for
Kubernetes and Spring Cloud Gateway for VMware Tanzu Application Service commercial offerings
with commercial-only capabilities and platform-integrated operator experiences.

The OSS and commercial offerings can be used as a reverse proxy with additional API Gateway
functions to handle request and response to upstream application services.

Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes is included in Tanzu Application Platform
v1.5 and later.

This topic helps you to migrate upstream applications that expose API routes on Spring Cloud Gateway
from Tanzu Application Service and custom OSS implementations to Tanzu Application Platform.
